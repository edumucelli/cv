I am a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, France. My Thesis tackled characterization, planning, and deployment problems of urban wireless networks using large-scale datasets of human mobililiy and data traffic. Besides, I am Linux and Open Source enthusiast for 15 years now. I have \hyperref[sec:open_source]{several projects}, created on my spare time.

Furthermore, I have made full-stack development of \hyperref[sec:web_app]{three web applications}. I.e., from the \textit{"\href{http://easy.bike}{Easy.Bike's}"} real-time backend crawlers, R-based statistics on \textit{"\href{http://www.proconfie.com}{Proconfie}"}, to the front-end on \textit{"\href{http://www.cepaberto.com}{CEP Aberto}"}, and the Apache and MySQL fine-tuning on the three of them within the same VPS.

% Briefly, the first, \textit{"\href{http://easy.bike}{Easy.Bike}"} is a free application that helps bike-sharing cyclers to find the best bicycle stations and route from their places to their destinations. The second, \textit{"\href{http://www.proconfie.com}{Proconfie}"}, is a free application that helps people to choose companies based on historical problems presented with other customers. It received Honorary Mention award from the Brazilian Ministry of Justice. Finally, \textit{"\href{http://www.cepaberto.com}{CEP Aberto}" (Open Postal Code)} is a free and collaborative application that aims to open publicly the Postal Code geolocalized data in Brazil, which even after several popular requests, can be only accessed by those who pay an absurd amount of money for the Brazilian Post-mail service. It provides an API for developers willing to use the Postal Code data and, for the end-users, the possibility to edit, add, fix, follow, specific postal-coded-locations in order to improve the quality of the data.

I have worked and experienced multicultural environments. I was born in Brazil, coursed part of my Master's Degree in Italy and, since 2011, I live in France. Besides Portuguese, I speak English, French, and Italian.

I am looking for a job in which I can apply my knowledge to do something that can positively change a huge amount of people's lives. I would like to do that full-time, not only during my spare time, an that is why I am applying for this position at Intel.
